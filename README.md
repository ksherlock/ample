# Ample

A slightly more user-friendly front-end for using MAME as an Apple II emulator. Requires Mac OS X 10.14+

A custom version of MAME is included (only apple 1/2/3 emulators are supported in the custom version).


Ample release 10 MAME includes the Macintosh (NuBus) driver and UI support for configuring and launching some Macintosh models.
Please note the following warning concerning MAME's Macintosh emulation: 

Mac emulation is still in progress. While many features work, some are not in place yet, and others are a consequence of accurate Mac emulation.

* 3.5" floppy support is a work in progress and currently only works with 400K/800K disks (to be fixed in the future)
* Images selected in the “Hard Drives” section must have a full partition table with Mac drivers (this will always be the case)
* "Hard Disk Images" (enabled with the NuBus Disk Image Pseudo-Card in a slot) can be used to mount standard HFS images without the need of a partition table or driver (this will always be the case)
