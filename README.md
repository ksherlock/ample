# Ample

A slightly more user-friendly front-end for using MAME as an Apple II emulator. Requires Mac OS X 10.11+

A custom version of MAME is included.  (Only Apple 1/2/3 and Macintosh emulators are included in the custom version).

A note for Macintosh emulation:

* Images selected in the “Hard Drives” section must have a full partition table with Mac drivers (this will always be the case)
* "Hard Disk Images" (enabled with the NuBus Disk Image Pseudo-Card in a slot) can be used to mount standard HFS images without the need of a partition table or driver (this will always be the case)
